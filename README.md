# Hi there,I am Bibhash Ghosh. 

I worked as a SDE-1 at Amazon, and as an Assistant System Enginner at TCS. I have completed my MCA ( Master of Computer Applications ) from Jadavpur University, West Bengal, India. 

My region of interest: Big Data, ETL, SQL, DWH, ML/DL and Computer Vision, Overall Python-based development.

Apart from that, I always love do Competitive Programming from my academics, and still exploring. Logic building and optimising a code/query excites me more than anything.

And also I am a weeb and I love to explore places and make new friends.

That's all about me in a nutshell, what about you?
